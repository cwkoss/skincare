I want to build a mobile-friendly webform for creating novel natural skincare product recipes. 

Users will first give some information about their skincare goals and concerns.   Then chatGPT API will use the users list of goals to formulate initial recipe ideas.   Users will vet and iterate those ideas until they come up with one or more recipes they want to try. When they are satisfied, they click "Order" and their recipe is formulated and delivered to them. Instead of just getting a single product, they get 2-4 variants of the product. Customers will receive small portions (1-2oz) so they can go through the product quickly, reducing the need for preservatives.

Once a user gets their formulations, they try them out.  Users can give feedback on the formulations - which grants the user store credit for future orders, as well as feeds the AI better information to determine which variants should be iterated on, and how to vary those "winners" to try to improve them even further. 

In this way, users gradually 'evolve' a skincare recipe that works well for them. 

Once users have a product they like and are proud of, they can publish it, and reshare it - whenever someone orders their recipe (or a derivative of their recipe) they get store credit towards their future purchases. In this way, users can create "their own skincare line" with an effort level more similar to dropshipping as they don't have to do any formulation or logistics themselves.

"Not sure", "Lotion", "Cream", "Butter", "Serum", "Toner" 

Cleanser: Used to remove dirt, oil, and makeup from the skin. It helps in keeping the pores clear and the skin clean. Common ingredients include surfactants like sodium lauryl sulfate for removing oil and dirt, and humectants like glycerin to retain moisture.

Toner: Applied after cleansing, toner helps to remove any remaining impurities and balances the pH of the skin. It can also provide additional cleansing for oily or acne-prone skin. Often contains astringents like witch hazel to tighten pores, hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid, and sometimes exfoliating acids like glycolic acid.

Serum: Highly concentrated with active ingredients, serums target specific skin concerns such as aging, hydration, or brightening. High concentrations of active ingredients like Vitamin C (ascorbic acid) for brightening, retinol for anti-aging, or niacinamide for reducing redness.

Moisturizer: Hydrates the skin and locks in moisture. It can come in various forms like lotions, creams, and gels, tailored to different skin types. Emollients like squalene or shea butter to soften, occlusives like petrolatum to lock in moisture, and humectants like glycerin to attract water to the skin.

Sunscreen: Protects the skin from harmful UV rays. It's essential for preventing sun damage, aging, and skin cancer.  Chemical UV filters like avobenzone or physical blockers like zinc oxide or titanium dioxide to protect against UV radiation.

Exfoliant: Removes dead skin cells from the surface of the skin, either physically (scrubs) or chemically (acids and peels), promoting a smoother and clearer complexion. Alpha hydroxy acids (AHAs) like glycolic acid for surface exfoliation, or beta hydroxy acids (BHAs) like salicylic acid for penetrating oil glands.

Face Oil: Provides intensive hydration and nourishment, especially beneficial for dry or mature skin. Plant oils like rosehip or jojoba oil, rich in fatty acids and antioxidants, to nourish and hydrate the skin.

Eye Cream: Specifically formulated for the delicate eye area, it targets concerns like dark circles, puffiness, and wrinkles.  Ingredients like caffeine to reduce puffiness, peptides for collagen production, and hyaluronic acid for hydration.

Mask: Used occasionally to address specific skin concerns. Masks can hydrate, detoxify, or provide anti-aging benefits. Clay ingredients for absorbing oil, hydrating ingredients like aloe vera, or exfoliating acids depending on the mask's purpose.

Lotion: A lightweight moisturizer, often used for normal to oily skin, providing hydration without being too heavy.  Similar to moisturizers but lighter, often containing a combination of water, glycerin, and lightweight oils.

Cream: Thicker than lotion, creams are ideal for dry skin as they provide more intensive moisturization.  Thicker than lotions, with higher concentrations of oils and butters, like shea butter or lanolin, for deeper moisturization.

Butter: Even thicker than creams, butters are used for very dry skin areas, providing deep nourishment and hydration. Heavy in occlusives like cocoa or shea butter for intense moisture and protection.

Balm: A dense, oil-based product, balms are used for intense healing and protection, often in specific areas like lips or dry patches.  Thick, oil-based, often containing beeswax or lanolin for creating a protective barrier and plant oils for nourishment.

Tinted Moisturizer: A light, hydrating cream that provides a hint of color, offering a natural alternative to foundation. Hydrating ingredients like moisturizers, with added pigments for color and sometimes SPF for sun protection.

Primer: Applied before makeup, it smooths the skin's surface and can help makeup last longer. Silicones like dimethicone for smoothing the skinâ€™s surface, and often light-reflective particles for a glowing appearance.

Micellar Water: A gentle cleansing option that removes makeup and impurities without the need for rinsing. Micelles (tiny oil molecules in soft water) that attract dirt and oil, allowing for gentle cleansing without harsh surfactants.

Facial Mist: Used to refresh and hydrate the skin throughout the day, often containing soothing ingredients like rosewater or aloe.  Water-based with added hydrating ingredients like rosewater, glycerin, or essential oils for a refreshing boost.

Spot Treatment: Targeted treatments for acne and blemishes, often containing ingredients like salicylic acid or benzoyl peroxide. Active ingredients like benzoyl peroxide to kill bacteria, or salicylic acid to unclog pores, often in an alcohol or water base for quick drying.

Sleeping Mask or Night Cream: A deeply hydrating product applied before bed to work overnight, often richer than a standard moisturizer. Typically richer in emollients and occlusives like ceramides or hyaluronic acid to deeply moisturize and repair skin overnight.

Peel: Typically a stronger form of exfoliant, peels use acids or enzymes to remove the top layer of dead skin cells, revealing fresher skin underneath. Higher concentrations of exfoliating acids (AHAs/BHAs) like lactic acid or enzymes to effectively remove dead skin cells and promote skin renewal.
